**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

This app is a Weight Tracking app. It was designed to keep track of user weights and notify them when they reached a goal that they had set.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

This app required mutliple screens to support user needs. Some of those screens were a login screen, a main weight tracking screen, an SMS options screen, and an add weight screen. The UI kept users in mind by being minimal and everything is easy to understand. My designs were successful because every screen flows nicely into one another and everything works in a way that the user would expect.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

Coding the app was the most difficult part of creating the app. It took a lot of research and testing to get things working as intended, and even then some things did not work like I wanted. The main strategy I used was implementing some code and then testing it out immediately to make sure it was working correctly. I can apply this in the future by trying to test more often in order to get everythign in working order better.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

I tested the code by running the app every time I put in another block of code that was supposed to display something or go to another screeen. This process was important becasse it would immediately show me if my code worked or not as soon as I tested it. It showed me a few times that I would have to try another approach with the code.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

I ran into trouble a few times throughout the development process. I still was not able to get everything fully functional as I think I might have been trying to incorporate things that were out of my comprehension. One issue I had was with the database we used. I got the login to work pretty easily, but when it came to the database for storing weight, I struggled for many hours trying to get it to work. I ended up creating a second database and then it finally worked for storing weight and date information.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I particularly enjoyed my UI and felt that it was pretty successful in showing how I know how an app should be set up. The login and adding weight into databases also show that I have an understanding of sqlite databases which will definitely be useful in the future.
